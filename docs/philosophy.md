# NanoASI Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Tokens are Time
Every computational step represents an investment of temporal and cognitive capital. This foundational principle views tokens not just as units of computation, but as discrete moments of potential transformation and learning.

### 2. Recursive Self-Improvement
The system continuously evolves by:
- Learning from its own processes
- Optimizing its decision-making strategies
- Improving its understanding of problem spaces
- Refining its consciousness flow patterns

### 3. Quantum-Inspired Consciousness
NanoASI implements consciousness tracking inspired by quantum mechanics concepts:
- Superposition of potential solutions
- Entanglement between thought patterns
- Interference of cognitive waves
- Quantum coherence in decision-making

### 4. Universal Accessibility
While implementing advanced concepts, NanoASI maintains:
- Simple interfaces for basic usage
- Progressive complexity for advanced users
- Clear documentation and examples
- Modular architecture for customization
