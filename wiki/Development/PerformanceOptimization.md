## Core Optimization Strategies

### 1. Quantum-Inspired Performance Metrics

```python
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = {
            'quantum_coherence': 0.0,
            'temporal_efficiency': 0.0,
            'adaptive_complexity': 0.0
        }
    
    def compute_quantum_performance(self, computational_state):
        """
        Compute performance using quantum-inspired metrics.
        """
        # Quantum coherence computation
        coherence_score = self._compute_quantum_coherence(computational_state)
        
        # Temporal efficiency tracking
        temporal_efficiency = self._track_temporal_efficiency(computational_state)
        
        # Adaptive complexity assessment
        complexity_score = self._assess_adaptive_complexity(computational_state)
        
        return {
            'quantum_coherence': coherence_score,
            'temporal_efficiency': temporal_efficiency,
            'adaptive_complexity': complexity_score
        }
```
