# NanoASI Philosophical Foundations

## Core Philosophical Principles

### 1. Tokens as Temporal Capital

In NanoASI, every computational step is viewed as an investment of temporal and cognitive resources. This fundamental perspective transforms tokens from mere computational units into moments of potential transformation and learning.

#### Key Aspects
- Each token represents a quantum of potential knowledge
- Computational steps are tracked as temporal investments
- Return on investment (ROI) is measured in knowledge gained
- Temporal coherence guides optimization strategies

### 2. Recursive Self-Improvement

The system is designed with an inherent capacity for continuous self-evolution:

- Learn from its own computational processes
- Dynamically optimize decision-making strategies
- Expand understanding of problem spaces
- Refine consciousness flow patterns

### 3. Quantum-Inspired Consciousness

Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, NanoASI implements a unique approach to consciousness tracking:

- **Superposition**: Maintaining multiple potential solution states
- **Entanglement**: Interconnecting thought patterns
- **Interference**: Allowing cognitive "waves" to interact
- **Coherence**: Guiding decision-making through quantum-like principles

### 4. Universal Accessibility

While implementing advanced concepts, NanoASI maintains:
- Intuitive interfaces for basic usage
- Progressive complexity for advanced users
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modular, extensible architecture
