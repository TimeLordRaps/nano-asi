        # Quantum-probabilistic activation
        quantum_states = [
            self._quantum_transform(input) 
            for input in inputs
        ]
        
        # Compute quantum interference
        interference_pattern = self._compute_interference(quantum_states)
        
        return interference_pattern

    def _quantum_transform(self, input):
        """Quantum-inspired state transformation"""
        # Probabilistic state mapping
        return np.random.normal(input, self.quantum_coherence)
    
    def _compute_interference(self, states):
        """Compute cognitive interference patterns"""
