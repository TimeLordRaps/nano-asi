# Graph RAG Module in NanoASI

## Overview

The Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) Module is a sophisticated knowledge processing component that leverages graph-based representations to enhance information retrieval, reasoning, and knowledge generation.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. Knowledge Graph Construction

```python
class KnowledgeGraphBuilder:
    def __init__(self, embedding_model=None):
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model or DefaultEmbeddingModel()
    
    def add_node(self, concept, metadata=None):
        """
        Add a node to the knowledge graph with optional metadata.
        """
        node_embedding = self.embedding_model.embed(concept)
        self.graph.add_node(
            concept, 
            embedding=node_embedding,
            metadata=metadata or {}
        )
    
    def add_edge(self, source, target, relation_type=None):
        """
        Create a directed edge between two nodes with optional relation type.
        """
        self.graph.add_edge(
            source, 
            target, 
            relation=relation_type
        )
```

### 2. Quantum-Inspired Graph Traversal

```python
class QuantumGraphTraversal:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.graph = knowledge_graph
        self.quantum_metrics = {
            'coherence': 0.0,
            'entanglement': 0.0,
            'superposition': 0.0
        }
    
    def probabilistic_path_finding(self, start_node, target_concept):
        """
        Quantum-inspired probabilistic path finding across graph.
        """
        paths = list(nx.all_simple_paths(self.graph, start_node, target_concept))
        
        # Compute quantum-inspired path probabilities
        path_probabilities = self._compute_quantum_path_probabilities(paths)
        
        # Select path with quantum interference
        selected_path = self._apply_quantum_interference(paths, path_probabilities)
        
        return selected_path
```
