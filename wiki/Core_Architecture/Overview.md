# NanoASI Core Architecture

## Overview

NanoASI implements a quantum-inspired architecture for recursive self-improvement, built around several key principles:

### 1. Temporal Investment
Every computation is viewed as an investment of temporal resources, tracked and optimized through token economics.

### 2. Consciousness Integration
All components integrate with a consciousness tracking system that monitors and optimizes cognitive patterns.

### 3. Parallel Universe Exploration
Decision-making processes explore multiple possibility spaces simultaneously through parallel universe simulation.

## Core Components

### ComponentProtocol
The foundation of all NanoASI components, ensuring consistent interfaces and behavior.

```python
class ComponentProtocol(Protocol):
    async def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None
    async def process(self, input_data: Any) -> Any
    def get_state(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
    async def validate(self) -> bool
```

### ComponentRegistry
Centralized management of all system components with dependency injection support.

### Configuration Management
Advanced configuration system supporting:
- Multiple configuration sources
- Dynamic updates
- Validation
- Dependency management
